        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            What is comfort food to you? If you're like me, and many other people in the world, one of the images that 
            comes to mind is a gorgeously crispy fried chicken. Simple but flavorful, fried chicken is a treat for both 
            kids and adults alike. Whether you're enjoying it at a kid's birthday party or serving it as an appetizer for 
            game night with your <em>barkada</em> (group of friends), crispy fried chicken is definitely a classic choice.

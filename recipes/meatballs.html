                Making this dish is simple and easy. All you need to do is combine the ground pork, onions, garlic, flour, egg, Knorr Pork Cube and 
                carrots in a bowl. Mix well making sure the Knorr Pork Cube is evenly distributed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season well with ground pepper and continue to blend. Allow to chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to an hour to allow the 
                mixture to firm up a bit before forming them into 1-1/2 to 2 inch balls. You can freeze the meatballs for later use or you can immediately 
                cook them after shaping.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now, get a pan and make it nice and hot over medium low heat. Pour some oil. Drop the meatballs in the hot oil and cook until it floats on 
                top and the color is golden brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the cooked meatballs and place them on top of a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil. Meatballs, as a dish, is so versatile. 
                You can have them as an appetizer, as a snack or served as a main dish with Sweet Chili Sauce on the side. You will find yourself eating more 
                than usual. It's just so good!

            <p>
                Filipino Spaghetti is the Pinoy version of Spaghetti with meat sauce. This version has a sweet tomato based sauce with 
                lots of meat ingredients such as ground pork, luncheon meat, and hotdogs. It is often served during kid's birthday parties 
                along with some yummy fried chicken and cake.
